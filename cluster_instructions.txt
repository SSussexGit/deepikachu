This file gives instructions for running on the cluster. 

1) login to leonhard by ssh: ssh [username]@login.leonhard.eth
2) make a folder and git pull this directory. Install Miniconda. Install nodejs using conda: conda install -c conda-forge nodejs. 
3) in terminal run: module load python_gpu/3.7.1
4) in the same folder as the training code: mkdir output
5) to run a batch of 5 training episodes on gpu run:

for i in `seq 1 5`; do bsub -W 12:00 -n 16 -R "rusage[mem=16000, ngpus_excl_p=1]"  "python game_coordinator_parallel.py $i"; done

Where "12:00" means the job takes 12 hours. "-n 16" means use 16 nodes. "rusage[mem=16000,ngpus_excl_p=1]" means use 16000 mb ram on cpus and use a single GPU (the max for students). 

6) To download the results run (on your machine): scp ssussex@login.leonhard.ethz.ch:directory/pokemon-showdown/output .

This information above specifically is for running on GPU. To run on CPU, do not do step 3 but instead load the Conda environment specified in "spec-file.txt". Then don't include the ",ngpus_excl_p=1" part when running.
